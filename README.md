# Challenge 11: Organized Note Taking App

## Description
As part of our routine, we use several types of apps to help us keep track of our responsibilities. We use calendar apps to record important events, and we also use note taking apps to store reminders and other information. The Note Taker app allows you to write and save notes, and you can delete them once you don't need them anymore. This project taught me how to write get, post, and delete routes; use functions from the FileSystem module to modify a JSON file; and add new parameters to objects.

## Installation
No installation is required for this project.

## Usage
The application starts at the home page. Clicking on the "Get Started" button takes you to the notes page. The left side lists your saved notes, and clicking on one of them displays its contents on the right side. In the navigation bar at the top, clicking on 'Note Taker' takes you back to the home page, and clicking the '+' icon enables you to write a new note. Once it has a title and body text, a save button appears. Clicking this button adds your entry to the list of saved notes. Each note has a red trash can icon next to it, and clicking the icon deletes the note.

The following images demonstrate the application's appearance:
